# odin-rockpaperscissors

The goal if this project is to make a simple rock paper scissors game the is played in the console(no gui for now). I am already moderately familiar with coding so the project won't be diffucult for me but the focus is on practicing javascript syntax and good practices like writing out pseudocode for the entire project before starting.
